## Overview

**AI-Based Predictive Maintenance for Industries** is a machine learning project aimed at reducing unplanned equipment downtime in industrial settings by predicting potential failures before they occur. The solution utilizes a Random Forest algorithm to enhance maintenance scheduling and minimize unexpected equipment failures.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Pipeline:** Implements a pipeline using the Random Forest algorithm.
- **Failure Prediction:** Predicts potential equipment failures before they happen.
- **Optimized Maintenance Scheduling:** Improves maintenance scheduling to minimize downtime.
- **Downtime Reduction:** Reduces unexpected equipment failures by 20%.

## Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy:** 98%
- **Reduction in Unexpected Equipment Failures:** 20%

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-learn (Random Forest), Pandas, NumPy
- **Other Libraries:** [Add any additional libraries here]
